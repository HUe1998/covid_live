# covid_live
A website that displays live covid cases by country through Pie Chart. 
I have used NodeJS, ExpressJS to handle the backend. I have also used EJS to pass variables from NodeJS to HTML.
To make the Pie Chart, I used Chart.JS. Moreover, I had to provide colors for all the countries. To automate this task
I used Palette.js available here:<br/>
